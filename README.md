# BLOCKCHAIN_POWERED_AI_HEALTHCARE_INSIGHTS

Our project Blockchain Powered AI Healthcare Insights creates AI tools that extract actionable insights from Electronic Health Records (EHR) stored in multi-chain-blockchain, helping doctors make informed decisions faster. It includes systems to analyze patient histories, predict adverse drug reactions, provide personalized treatment recommendations, and predict post-surgical complications based on preoperative data.

We have also used IPFS(Inter-planetery file system) which is a decentralized file system where the prescriptions are uploaded and stored,once it is uploaded a CID is generated which is Content Identifier which is a unique key for each prescription which is stored in the multi-chain-blockchain.
